# Step 1: Use flutter image to build the web app
FROM ghcr.io/cirruslabs/flutter:stable AS build

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy everything
COPY . .

# Enable flutter web
RUN flutter config --enable-web

# Get dependencies and build web release
RUN flutter pub get
RUN flutter build web

# Step 2: Use nginx (lightweight web server) to serve the built files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Remove default nginx website
RUN rm -rf /usr/share/nginx/html/*

# Copy build output from flutter
COPY --from=build /app/build/web /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
